Invoice Generator
This is a Python-based web application built with Flask that generates professional PDF invoices. Users can input invoice details, item descriptions, quantities, and prices, and the application will create a clean, printable PDF with calculated totals.

A key feature of this application is its ability to correctly render both the US Dollar ($) and Indian Rupee (â‚¹) symbols in the generated PDF, which was achieved by using a Unicode-compatible font.

Setup and Installation
To run this application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: If you haven't already, clone the project from GitHub.
