OutriX Tasks
This repository contains my completed tasks for the OutriX internship program. Each folder represents a separate project, demonstrating skills in full-stack development, database management, and automation.

1. Simple Bug Tracker
A Simple Web-Based Bug Tracking System
This project is a basic, single-user bug tracking system built as a web application. It allows a user to log new bugs, view a list of all existing bugs, and update the status of each bug. The application is designed to be lightweight and easy to set up for personal use or a small-scale project.

Technologies Used
Backend: Python 3 with the Flask framework

Database: MySQL

Frontend: HTML and CSS

Features
Add New Bug: A form to submit new bug reports with a title, description, and initial status.

View All Bugs: A dashboard that displays a list of all reported bugs.

Update Bug Status: An option to change the status of a bug (e.g., from Open to In Progress or Closed).

2. Invoice Generator
A PDF Invoice Generator
This is a Python-based web application built with Flask that generates professional PDF invoices. Users can input invoice details, item descriptions, quantities, and prices, and the application will create a clean, printable PDF with calculated totals.

A key feature of this application is its ability to correctly render both the US Dollar ($) and Indian Rupee (â‚¹) symbols in the generated PDF, which was achieved by using a Unicode-compatible font.

Technologies Used
Backend: Python with Flask

PDF Generation: reportlab library
